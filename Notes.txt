I've created a responsive implementation of the portfolio design using vanilla HTML and CSS. Key features include:

Clean, modern layout with a light cream background
Responsive navigation with social links
Hero section with circular profile image
About section with timeline
Work section with case studies
Contact section with links
Mobile-responsive design
The design uses CSS variables for consistent colors and spacing, and implements a responsive grid layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. You can customize the colors, fonts, and content to match your preferences.
